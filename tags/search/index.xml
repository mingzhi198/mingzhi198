      <description>From this chapter we get to know graphs, which is a new data structure and can help us model a network. We also get to know a new algorhtim named breadth-first search, which can help us find the shortest path. We review the difference between directed and undirected graphs. We get to know a new sorting algorithm called topological sort, which can help us know dependent relationships between nodes.</description>
