      <description>Statement  This article is my study notes from the book: grokking algorithm: an illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people. Please refer to the original work for more details and indicate the source for reprinting.    From this chapter we get to know graphs, which is a new data structure and can help us model a network. We also get to know a new algorhtim named breadth-first search, which can help us find the shortest path.</description>
