      <description>This blog is used as notes for later reference after reading the book &amp;lsquo;Algorithms an illustrated guide for programmers&amp;rsquo;  Chapter 2: Selection Sort 1. Tips About Selection Sort  Your computer’s memory is like a giant set of drawers. When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list. With an array, all your elements are stored right next to each other. With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one.</description>

      <description>This blog is used as notes for later reference after reading the book &amp;lsquo;Algorithms an illustrated guide for programmers&amp;rsquo;  Chapter 1: Binary Search 1. Tips About Binary Search * Binary search is a lot faster than simple search. * O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you’re searching through grows. * Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds. * Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.</description>
