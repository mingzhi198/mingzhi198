      <description>Statement  This article is my study notes about algorithms. Please refer to the original work for more details and indicate the source for reprinting.  1. What is Bubble Sort? Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that is simple and obvious.
We do it in the following steps:
1. We iterate elements of an array in pairs and then switch them if the sequence of elements in a pair is not correct.</description>

Be cautious that elements to the left of the beginning index are already sorted, thus we can stop redundant comparison if the beginning indexed element is bigger than the previous one.</description>
