      <description>From this chapter we get to know graphs, which is a new data structure and can help us model a network. We also get to know a new algorhtim named breadth-first search, which can help us find the shortest path. We review the difference between directed and undirected graphs. We get to know a new sorting algorithm called topological sort, which can help us know dependent relationships between nodes.</description>

      <description>1. Requirements for hash function  It needs to be consistent. It should map different workds to different numbers.  You get a hash table by putting a hash function and an array together. Hash tables use an array to store data since we can get an item from an array instantly(O(1)).
2. Use cases 2.1 Using hash tables for lookups Hash tables make it easy to model a relationship from one item to another.</description>

      <description>This chapter I learned divide-and-conquer and quicksort, both of which can help me solve problems elegently.
 1. Divide &amp;amp; Conquer  It can take us some time to understand D&amp;amp;C. Therefore, we will see some problems to learn about it.
 Example If you are a farmer with a large land and plan to divide this farmland evenly into square plots.
Besides, the plots must be as big as possible.</description>

      <description>In this chapter, I learned about recursion, which is very useful in many algorithms. Also, this chapter shows us how to break down a problem into a base case and a recursive case.
 1. Recursion If you have a box containing more boxes, in which there will be no or more boxes.
The key is in one of the boxes.
How can you do to search for the key?</description>

      <description>1. Background We sometimes use more than one github account to manage different repositories. Even though we&#39;ve set the config file(~/.ssh/config) correctly and test(ssh -T git@github.com) correctly, it will promote &amp;quot;permission denied(public key)&amp;quot; while we hit git push.  The problem is that we need to clarify different hosts for different users. And make the Host of url in you repository config the same as that of ~/.ssh/config  2. Here is the content of my git config file(~/.</description>

      <description>This blog is used as notes for later reference after reading the book &amp;lsquo;Algorithms an illustrated guide for programmers&amp;rsquo;  Chapter 2: Selection Sort 1. Tips About Selection Sort  Your computer’s memory is like a giant set of drawers. When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list. With an array, all your elements are stored right next to each other. With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one.</description>

      <description>This blog is used as notes for later reference after reading the book &amp;lsquo;Algorithms an illustrated guide for programmers&amp;rsquo;  Chapter 1: Binary Search 1. Tips About Binary Search * Binary search is a lot faster than simple search. * O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you’re searching through grows. * Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds. * Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.</description>

      <description>Some people may think that they can do a better job and make fewer mistakes if they deal with things in a serious mood.
However, I believe that people should work out solutions with a light mood since it can bring them many benefits.
Taking things easy can help people relax and perform better.
According to a psychological report from China Daily, stress can have adverse effects on their jobs.</description>

      <description>DO you agree or disagree with the following statement?
People who live in small villages or farm areas are more satisfied with their lives than people who live in cities.
 Some people may think that people living in rural areas, such as villages and farms, are more contented with their lives since there is a better environment in Villages and farms.
In my opinion, however, most people are satisfied with living in cities because it can have more benefits than living in rural areas.</description>

      <description>Many people may think that young students can learn a lot by doing a great deal of homework. However, teachers should assign their students with tasks that can be finished within thirty minutes since it will bring young students a lot more benefits.
Fewer assignments with crucial elements can help young students study more efficiently. People commonly held that the more assignments to do, the more young students could learn. Many students are frustrated with the burden tasks and thus tend to finish the tasks quickly.</description>
