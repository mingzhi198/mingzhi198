<hr>
<p>[Opening Sentence] Even though there are limited government resources for arts and sports funding, money is often misspent on athletics and Olympic teams.<br>
[Thesis statement] However, I believe that governments should put more resources and money on art projects since it will bring a lot more benefits to society and people.</p>
<p>[Topic 1] Through their creation of the arts, some people become larger-than-life inspirations to everyone.<br>
Hence, governments need to support these people as much as possible.<br>
[General Statement] Artists often serve as representatives of a nation’s culture.<br>
[Example] For example, great composers and other artists, such as Beethoven, Mozart, Van Gogh, and Rembrandt, are cultural icons in their home countries. Their genius is recognized worldwide.<br>
Without funding for art schools, orchestras, operas, and plays, future artists would have nowhere to improve their work.<br>
[Closing sentence] By providing funding for arts, governments can ensure a steady flow of cultural icons.</p>
<p>[Topic 2] By enjoying artworks, people can relieve pressure in life and feel peaceful.<br>
[General Statement] Due to the burden load of work and life, most people live with tremendous pressure. However, it can help them forget things unhappy when they focus on the artwork.<br>
[Example] For instance, I work as a software engineer for one of the biggest game companies. I often work on more than three projects at the same time. Besides, there are always new requirements changed before the deadline, and we should report the progress every morning of Monday. Therefore, I often get tired and exhausted after the end of a day’s work. Nevertheless, I happened to found an art museum funded by the government in my community. Then I get used to visiting there every day after work. By walking through various artifacts for no more than fifteen minutes, I would feel relieved and forget anything unhappy.<br>
[Closing sentence] Indeed, if governments spend more money on art, it can provide more places for people to relax.</p>
<p>[Topic 2] Besides, since Arts are essential in school education, governments should allocate more resources for arts.<br>
[General Statement] Many students study music and painting at a young age, and most of them are very talented artists. Without support from the governments, there would be no means for these future artists to develop their abilities.<br>
[Example] Take my country as an example. With financial support from the government, many schools have courses related to arts, such as music, painting, etc. Also, there are lots of professional art colleges where students can study the arts deeply. Through studying arts, we can learn about different cultures and their ideals.<br>
[Closing sentence] However, if the governments had not paid more attention to art, we would lose the chance to extend our knowledge about art.</p>
<p>[Summary] In conclusion, governments should spend more money and put more resources to support the arts.<br>
[Final Comment] By funding the development of art, people can get inspired, feel less stressed, and have opportunities to study art.</p>

<li>Tip<br>
If you follow the format above and get enough specific ideas and examples to support your points and practice a lot,<br>
you&rsquo;ll get at least 25+ in your TOEFL writing.<br>
Of course, it&rsquo;s based on large vocabulary of at least 8000+ and basic grammar knowledge.</li>
