    <p>DO you agree or disagree with the following statement?<br>
People who live in small villages or farm areas are more satisfied with their lives than people who live in cities.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some people may think that people living in rural areas, such as villages and farms, are more contented with their lives since there is a better environment in Villages and farms.<br>
In my opinion, however, most people are satisfied with living in cities because it can have more benefits than living in rural areas.</p>
<p>For one thing, living in cities can help us make more friends.(social)<br>
Since there are many people from different regions in cities, we have more chances to know various people than in remote areas.<br>
For example, there are three famous art museums and five fantastic gyms near our community where you can see many people. Moreover, I like working out at the gym after work and on weekends. By exercising at the gym, I got a chance to know my best friends, who help me a lot in my life and encourage me to learn Spanish.<br>
Nevertheless, I couldn‚Äôt have a chance to make more friends if I had lived in rural areas.</p>
<p>Besides, living in cities can save us lots of time and trouble. There are more malls and markets in towns for people to go shopping than in remote areas. (daily life)<br>
Even people from rural areas have to admit that living in rural areas is inconvenient. They often complain that they have to drive for more than one hour to buy living stuff or go to the hospital.<br>
According to a statistical analysis from China Daily, there is at least one merchandise market and one hospital in every city district, let alone numerous clinics distributing in different city communities. Thus, it will take us less than one hour to buy some fruits and vegetables, which make our lives more convenient.<br>
However, you have to spend half the day to go shopping if you live in remote areas.</p>
<p>Furthermore, more job opportunities are available in cities than in rural areas. (career)<br>
We all know that companies are usually located in big cities since there are more talented people and developed transportation. According to a career analysis from the Times, the rate of changing jobs in cities is much higher than in rural areas because you can find a new job easily if you don‚Äôt like your current workplace.<br>
I live in Silly Valley, known as programmers‚Äô heaven, where there are many famous companies.  As a software engineer, I‚Äôve never worried that I cannot find a job. Also, there are always popular activities, in which you can know some people who want to find competent employees. Five years ago, I worked as an embedded software engineer in a small company. I was depressed and frustrated during the year I was there because of our boss‚Äôs bad temper. Then, I left there and found a job in another company.<br>
Thus, living in cities can have more opportunities in a career.</p>
<p>In conclusion, people living in cities are more satisfied with their lives than people living in rural areas.<br>
Living in cities can help people make more friends, be more convenient, and provide more job opportunities.</p>
