      <p>Some people may think that they can do a better job and make fewer mistakes if they deal with things in a serious mood.<br>
However, I believe that people should work out solutions with a light mood since it can bring them many benefits.</p>
<p>Taking things easy can help people relax and perform better.<br>
According to a psychological report from China Daily, stress can have adverse effects on their jobs.<br>
For example, I was an engineer five years ago and often got lots of work every day. Sometimes, there would be at least ten machines with issues that need repair. The machines&rsquo; intricate system makes it challenging work since there were numerous electric lines and various equipment. And some of them are very sensitive to static electricity, so we must be careful and patient.
Lots of people would be frustrated after hours of work. However, I found that I could do better and finish my job with high efficiency after drinking coffee and relaxation.<br>
Indeed, doing a job with relaxation can us improve work efficiency.</p>
<p>Being happy can help people make friends more easily.<br>
People with a light mood are more likely to make a good impression on other people. Thus they think that you are a kind person and want to communicate with you.<br>
Take my brother Tom as an instance. He is a software engineer in a big company and gets lots of work every day. Even though he is often busy with his job, he manages to be happy and comfortable by listening to music. Besides, he is very kind and willing to help other people, making him very popular in the office. Moreover, he is used to taking a walk with his colleagues during the break because that can make him think clearly and less stressful.<br>
Since Tom is always easy with his work, we often see lots of friends at his house.</p>
<p>Learn to be relaxed can be helpful to people&rsquo;s health.<br>
We all know that being serious for a long time makes people feel tired, frustrated, and get health problems more frequently.<br>
In contrast, being relaxed can bring people more positive effects.<br>
For example, my father is a famous psychology doctor in a local hospital. And he often meets with lots of people with psychological problems. He often tells us that most people have no or less psychical issues at first. But after a long term of pressure, some of them don&rsquo;t sleep well or have a good appetite. And finally, they get various problems, such as high blood pressure. Nevertheless, most of these health issues would disappear if they learned to relax.<br>
Therefore, people would be more healthy if they can deal with things in a light mood.</p>
<p>In conclusion, dealing with works or studies with relaxation will have more benefits for people.<br>
It can help people work more efficiently, make new friends relatively quickly, and have less health problems.</p>
