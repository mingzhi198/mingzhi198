      <p>Some people may think that young children should not use new technology and limit their use of technology because it is harmful to young children.<br>
In my opinion, however, new technology can be useful for children&rsquo;s studies and bring them a lot more benefits.</p>
<p>Using technology can help young students improve their study.<br>
Today, computers and the Internet are beneficial to students because there are many excellent computer tools related to study.<br>
Take me as an instance. I was interested in computer science and loved programming when I was in middle school ten years ago. But I encountered a big problem since I didn&rsquo;t have enough money to buy a computer. Nevertheless, our teachers told us that there were lots of computers in our library, in which we can learn a lot about programming. Then, I would go to the computer library and stay until midnight every day.<br>
If not for the new technology, I would have no chance to improve my study and programming skills.</p>
<p>Besides, the use of new technology can help young kids broaden their horizons.<br>
Through the Internet, young kids can learn a lot about different cultures and read various books from various countries and regions.<br>
For example, my brother Tom loves English literature. He often went to a bookstore downtown to read books. But it usually took him at least two hours to get there since he lived very far away from the downtown. However, his father bought him a computer last year. By reading information online, he can read lots of books and find interesting information about other cultures.<br>
With the help of new technology, it saved Tom a lot of trouble to study and broadened his horizons.</p>
<p>Moreover, young students can also take online courses under some conditions.<br>
It&rsquo;s not always convenient and efficient for students and teachers to meet in classrooms.<br>
Instead, studying and teaching online would be an excellent solution to this problem.<br>
Take the current world as an instance. After breaking a dangerous virus, many people are limited to their communities and keep a safe social distance.
To limit the spread of the virus, governments closed many, and thus students can go nowhere buy stay at home. However, many teachers now teach their students through online programs. By studying online, children can continue their classes.<br>
Yet, children&rsquo;s study would be affected without the help of technology.</p>
<p>In conclusion, new technology is essential for young children and can benefit them a lot.<br>
With the assistance of modern technology, it can help young students improve their study, broaden their horizons, and study online conveniently.</p>
